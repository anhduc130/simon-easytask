I created a callback function called rememberKeys which is inside the NoteBox for every time we click on the note box. This function will add all the keys that the user has punched in into an array called keysArray. After 2.5s, I call another function playNotes, which will play all the notes that in the keysArray.

The resources that I used for this task is from www.w3schools.com, where I learn about a new function called setInterval() that helps me solve this problem.
